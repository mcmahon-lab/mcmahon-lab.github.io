<b>Conference description</b><br />
There has been an explosion of interest in <b>unconventional approaches to computing</b> with physical systems, both <b>classical</b> and <b>quantum</b> <font style="color:#999999;">(some recent reviews: [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-022-00440-8" target="_blank">MMB2022</a>], [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-040821-113439" target="_blank">SM2023</a>], [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2973-6" target="_blank">WOG+2020</a>])</font>. This has been driven by multiple factors, including (1) the realization that there is the potential to build vastly more energy-efficient or faster computers if we <b>rethink how we harness physical processes for computing</b> – giving up some of the abstractions computers have relied on for 50+ years in exchange for being able to operate closer to the fundamental limits that physics allows, and (2) the growth of machine learning – which provides both a strong motivator for more efficient machines to be built, as well as a wealth of methods that can be used to reimagine how computers work. This Aspen Winter Conference will bring together both theorists and experimentalists across a broad range of disciplines – including soft condensed matter, biological physics, neuroscience, machine learning, hard condensed matter, optics, fluid dynamics, and quantum information science – who typically do not have the opportunity to interact but who are all exploring various aspects of computing in different physical systems. Topics will include:

<ul style="color:#C00000;">
	<li><b>Information processing and dynamics in classical and quantum systems</b>, including (but not limited to) electronic, spintronic, optical, mechanical, fluidic, biological, and chemical systems.</li>
	<li><b>Devices, architectures, and algorithms</b> for constructing physical machines that can learn without electronic processors.</li>
	<li><b>Fundamental limits to computing</b>: time, energy, precision.</li>
	<li><b>Integrated sensing, computation, and actuation</b>.</li>
</ul>

The conference will feature invited talks and discussion sessions. All participants will be invited to present posters. A welcome reception will be held on Sunday 7 January 2024, and the scientific program will take place from Monday 8 January 2024 until lunchtime on Friday 12 January 2024.

<br /><br />
<b>Applications</b><br />
We welcome applications for participation from researchers at all career stages and encourage all participants to present a poster. Per the Aspen Center for Physics, <b>everyone (including organizers and invited speakers) must apply to participate</b>. If your application is accepted, you will receive a password to register. Please use the following link to the <a href="https://aspenphys.org/db/index.php">application form</a>.

<br /><br />
<b>Logistics</b><br />
The scientific organizers are grateful that the logistics of the conference are largely handled by the <a href="https://aspenphys.org" target="_blank">Aspen Center For Physics</a>.
